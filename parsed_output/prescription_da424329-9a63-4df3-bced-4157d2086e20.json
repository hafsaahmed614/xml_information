      "text_plain": "Advise the patient and family members or caregivers to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Patient Information and Instructions for Use ). Recognition of Opioid Overdose Inform patients and their family members or caregivers about how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose such as the following: \u2022 Extreme somnolence \u2013 inability to awaken a patient verbally or upon a firm sternal rub. \u2022 Respiratory depression \u2013 this can range from slow or shallow respiration to no respiration in a patient who is unarousable. \u2022 Other signs and symptoms that may accompany somnolence and respiratory depression include the following: \u2022 Miosis \u2022 Bradycardia and/or hypotension Risk of Recurrent Respiratory and Central Nervous System Depression Instruct patients and their family members or caregivers that, because the duration of action of most opioids may exceed that of KLOXXADO, they must seek immediate emergency medical assistance after the first dose of KLOXXADO and keep the patient under continued surveillance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Limited Efficacy for/with Partial Agonists or Mixed Agonist/Antagonists Instruct patients and their family members or caregivers that the reversal of respiratory depression caused by partial agonists or mixed agonist/antagonists, such as buprenorphine and pentazocine, may be incomplete and may require higher doses of naloxone hydrochloride or repeated administration of KLOXXADO, using a new nasal spray each time [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Precipitation of Severe Opioid Withdrawal Instruct patients and their family members or caregivers that the use of KLOXXADO in patients who are opioid dependent may precipitate opioid withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ), Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. Administration Instructions Instruct patients and their family members or caregivers to: \u2022 Ensure KLOXXADO is present and readily available in locations where a person may be intentionally or accidentally exposed to an opioid overdose (i.e., opioid emergencies). \u2022 Administer KLOXXADO as quickly as possible if a patient is unresponsive and an opioid overdose is suspected, even when in doubt, because prolonged respiratory depression may result in damage to the central nervous system or death. KLOXXADO is not a substitute for emergency medical care [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. \u2022 Lay the patient on their back and administer KLOXXADO into one nostril while providing support to the back of the neck to allow the head to tilt back [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. \u2022 Use each nasal spray only one time, DO NOT test or prime prior to use [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. \u2022 Place patient in a recovery position by turning him/her to their side as shown in the Instructions for Use and call for emergency medical assistance immediately after administration of the first dose of KLOXXADO. Additional supportive and/or resuscitative measures may be helpful while awaiting emergency medical assistance [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. \u2022 Monitor patients and administer additional dose of KLOXXADO using a new KLOXXADO every 2 to 3 minutes, if the patient is not responding or responds and then relapses back into respiratory depression. Administer KLOXXADO in alternate nostrils with each dose [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. \u2022 Replace KLOXXADO before its expiration date. Distributed by: Hikma Specialty USA Inc.

How to use KLOXXADO nasal spray: Step 1 . Lay the person on their back to receive a dose of KLOXXADO nasal spray. Step 2. Remove KLOXXADO nasal spray from the box.

Step 4. Tilt the person\u2019s head back and provide support under the neck with your hand.

If additional KLOXXADO nasal sprays are available, Steps 2 through 6 may be repeated every 2 to 3 minutes, alternating nostrils, until the person responds or emergency medical help is received.
